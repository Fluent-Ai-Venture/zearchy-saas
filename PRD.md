# ZipTrie Search Platform - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

ZipTrie Search Platform is a high-performance, SaaS-based search solution that utilizes a memory-efficient ZipTrie algorithm to provide ultra-fast, in-memory search capabilities. The platform allows users to upload JSON/CSV data and perform searches with exceptional speed and accuracy.

The ZipTrie algorithm is based on research published in ["ZipTrie: High-Performance Lexical Search for Big Data Applications"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04953), which demonstrates significant performance improvements over traditional search algorithms.
